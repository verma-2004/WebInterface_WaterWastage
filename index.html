        <h3>EFFECTS</h3>
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Environmental degradation: Water wastage contributes to environmental degradation, as it puts unnecessary
              strain on the natural water sources, and can lead to the depletion of water bodies.
            </li><br>
            <li>Water scarcity: Water wastage can lead to water scarcity, which can have severe consequences for both
              human and animal populations. This can lead to competition for water resources, which can cause conflict
              and social unrest.</li><br>
            <li>Economic loss: Water wastage can cause significant economic losses, particularly in areas where water is
              scarce. This is because water is a precious resource, and wastage can lead to increased costs for
              businesses, farmers, and households.</li><br>
            <li>Reduced food production: Water wastage can reduce food production, as it can lead to reduced irrigation
              and water for crops, which can affect the overall yield and quality of food produced.</li><br>
            <li>Drought: Water wastage can contribute to drought conditions, as it can reduce the overall water
              availability in a region, which can have a ripple effect on the climate, rainfall patterns, and
              vegetation.</li><br>
            <li>Energy consumption: Water wastage can lead to increased energy consumption, as it can require more
              energy to pump water to areas where it is needed. This can lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and

        <h3>STEPS FOR REDUCING IT</h3>
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>Fix Leaks: Inspect your plumbing system regularly and repair any leaks as soon as possible. Even a small
              leak can waste a significant amount of water over time.</li><br>
            <li>Install low-flow fixtures: Replace old showerheads, faucets, and toilets with low-flow models, which use
              less water but still provide adequate water pressure.</li><br>
            <li>Shorten shower time: Limit the time you spend in the shower to conserve water. Consider taking a shorter
              shower or turning off the water while you are soaping up.</li><br>
            <li>Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth: Don't let the water run while you're brushing your teeth, and
              only turn it on when you need to rinse.</li><br>
            <li>Water plants efficiently: Water your plants early in the morning or late in the evening when the
              temperature is cooler to prevent evaporation. Also, use a watering can or a hose with a trigger nozzle to
              control the amount of water you use.</li><br>
            <li>Water your lawn and plants in the early morning or evening: Watering during the cooler parts of the day
              reduces water loss due to evaporation.</li><br>
            <li>Use a broom instead of a hose to clean driveways and sidewalks: Using a broom instead of a hose can save
              a significant amount of water.</li><br>
            <li>Only run your dishwasher and washing machine when they are full: Running full loads of laundry and
              dishes can save water and energy.</li><br>
            <li>Check your water meter: Monitor your water meter regularly to detect any unusual water consumption. If
              you notice a spike in your water usage, it could indicate a leak or other issue.</li><br>

    <h4 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 69);font-size: larger;font-weight: 23px;">Water wastage is a growing concern worldwide
      due to the depletion of freshwater resources caused by population growth, industrialization, and urbanization.
      Water is a precious natural resource that is essential for life and various economic activities. However, the
      world faces a water crisis, and one of the leading causes is the wastage of water.

      The United Nations estimates that by 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in regions with absolute water
      scarcity, and two-thirds of the world's population could be living under water-stressed conditions. According to
      the World Bank, global demand for freshwater is projected to exceed supply by 40% by 2030. The World Economic
      Forum has also listed the water crisis as the third most significant risk facing the planet, after climate change
      and natural disasters.

      In the United States, water wastage is a significant concern, with an estimated 1.7 trillion gallons of water lost
      annually due to leaky pipes, outdated infrastructure, and inefficient water management practices. This is
      equivalent to the annual household water usage of 11 million people. According to the Environmental Protection
      Agency (EPA), a household can waste up to 180 gallons of water per week due to common leaks, which can add up to
      more than 9,000 gallons of wasted water per year.

      The agriculture sector is the largest consumer of water, accounting for 70% of the world's freshwater withdrawals.
      However, irrigation systems are often inefficient, leading to water wastage. According to the Food and Agriculture
      Organization (FAO), up to 60% of the water used for irrigation is wasted due to inefficient irrigation practices.

      The industrial sector is also a significant contributor to water wastage, with water-intensive industries such as
      mining, energy production, and manufacturing consuming vast amounts of water. The textile industry is one of the
      most water-intensive industries, with up to 2,700 liters of water required to produce a single cotton shirt. The
      pulp and paper industry is also a significant water user, with up to 200,000 liters of water required to produce
      one metric ton of paper.

      Water wastage also has significant economic costs. The EPA estimates that the cost of water and wastewater
      infrastructure needs in the United States will exceed $750 billion over the next two decades. Additionally, water
      bills for households and businesses can be significantly higher due to water wastage. In California, for example,
      the cost of water due to leaks and other wastage problems is estimated to be $1 billion annually.

      Water wastage can also have significant environmental impacts, leading to the depletion of freshwater resources,
      the loss of aquatic habitats, and the destruction of ecosystems. The overuse of groundwater resources has led to
      the depletion of aquifers in many regions, leading to land subsidence, reduced water availability, and increased
      water contamination.

      In conclusion, water wastage is a significant concern that has significant negative impacts on the environment,
      economy, and society. The depletion of freshwater resources due to wastage and overuse is a growing concern
      worldwide, and urgent action is needed to address this issue. Governments, businesses, and individuals must take
      steps to implement efficient water management practices, education and awareness campaigns, water reuse and
      recycling, and rainwater harvesting to reduce water wastage and ensure the sustainable use of this precious
      natural resource.</h4>

    <h1 style="color: red;">SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL</h1><br>
    <br>
    <h4 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 69);font-size: larger;font-weight: 23px;">The Sustainable Development Goal that can be
      achieved by reducing water wastage is Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.

      Reducing water wastage can help to conserve water resources, which is crucial for achieving clean water and
      sanitation for all. By reducing water wastage, we can ensure that the available water resources are used
      efficiently and sustainably, and that they are accessible to all. This can help to address water scarcity and
      improve water quality, which are key challenges in many parts of the world.

      In addition to conserving water resources, reducing water wastage can also have broader environmental and social
      benefits. For example, it can help to reduce energy consumption, as pumping and treating water requires
      significant amounts of energy. It can also reduce the pollution and environmental damage associated with
      extracting, transporting, and treating water.

      Overall, reducing water wastage is an important step towards achieving a sustainable future, and it can contribute
      to several of the Sustainable Development Goals, including</h4> <br><br>
